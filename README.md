Welcome to importShoes.dev!
=============

importShoes.dev is built for showing my abilities, so it is not actual business.
For the sake of proving my skills in both front and back end, it is built from scratch.

The below is the list of skills that I used for building this site.

- Back-end
  - Laravel v5.4
- Front-end
  - vue.js v2.1.10
- CSS Preprocessor
  - Stylus
- CSS System
  - ITCSS

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Web App and Development from Utah Valley University in May 2017.
If you are interested in working with me, please contact me via [Linkedin](aaa)!!
